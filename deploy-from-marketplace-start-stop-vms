Make the following changes to the script:

    Replace "YourResourceGroupName" with the desired name for the resource group where the solution will be deployed.
    Replace "YourLocation" with the Azure region or location where you want to deploy the solution.
    Replace "YourVmScheduleName" with the name for the VM schedule you want to create.
    Replace "YourOffHourTimezone" and "YourOnHourTimezone" with the desired timezones for off-hours and on-hours, respectively.
    Replace "YourEmailNotification" with the email address for receiving notifications.
    Replace "YourEmailSendTo" with the email address to which notifications will be sent.

The script checks if the resource group exists and creates it if it doesn't exist. It then deploys the "Start/Stop VMs during off hours - V2" solution using the template from the Azure Quickstart Templates GitHub repository.

After running the script, it will provide the status of the deployment and indicate whether it succeeded or failed.

Ensure you have the Azure PowerShell module installed and authenticated with the appropriate Azure account before running the script.
